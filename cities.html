    <ul>
        <li>Luxembourg, Luxembourg</li>

        <li>Trier, Germany</li>
    </ul>

        <p>I visited Trier and Luxembourg in the summer of 2019, and they both are absolutely beautiful. Luxembourg is number on my list of favorite cities, because it was a nice peaceful small town and I the people there were so friendly. Trier has a nice winery field and a town that is not too far from it. The scenery going driving down from mountains into a valley can't be beat. Traverse City is probably the most random city I visited, but it too is a nice queit town. You can tell not much goes on there and that's the way I like it.</p>

    Top Three Countries I Want To Visit</h1>

    <ol>
        <strong><li>Zealand</li></strong>
        <em><li>Mexico</li></em>
        <strong><li>Ethiopia</li></strong>
    </ol>

    <p>New Zealand has always been a placed I wanted to travel to since I was a kid. The Lord of the Rings is what actually insired me to want to see such a beautiful place. I also enjoy seeing lots of open land and greenary. Mexico and Ethopia are on the list mainly because of the food. I would love to try Ethiopian food from there. I plan on visiting Vera Cruz, Mexico to visit my childhood friend.</p>
